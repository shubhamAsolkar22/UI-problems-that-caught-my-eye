<!-- You may ocassionally encounter an HTML document that uses href="JavaScript:Void(0);" within an <a> element.

JavaScript void is often used when, inserting an expression into a web page may produce an unwanted side-effect.

By using JavaScript:Void(0), you can eliminate the unwanted side-effect, because it will return the undefined primative value.

A common usage of JavaScript:Void(0) is with hyperlinks.

Sometimes, you may need to call some JavaScript from within a link. Normally, when you click a link, the browser loads a new page or refreshes the same page (depending on the URL specified). But you probably don't want this to happen if you've attached some JavaScript to that link.

To prevent the page from refreshing, you could use JavaScript:void(0).
